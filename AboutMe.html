									<h3 class="major">Hi! My name is Kyle Huang</h3>
									<p>Welcome to my portfolio that includes all of my projects and lab work that I have done. I am an electronics engineer who loves to play sports and video games. I was originally a mechanical engineer but found myself in the ESET program at CPP where I fell in love with the work and potential. As someone who is heavily interested in tech and loves to build his own computers, electronics engineering seemed to be the place for me. Throughout my educational career I found myself developing a particular fondness to control systems and software design. In particular, FPGAs and robotics or autonomy are heavy interests of mine especially with technology advancing at the rate it is.</p>

									<p>Regarding myself as a person, as said, I enjoy playing video games especially at a competitive level. When I was younger I was a competitive Call of Duty player who was given the opportunity to travel for competitions. I also played a wide variety of sports such as soccer, baseball, and basketball with basketball being my favorite to play. I enjoy socialising and seeing those around me happy and laughing. In terms of character, I find myself to be a very diligent and hard-working individual. I hold myself to a high standard and try to do my best in any work that I undertake. I am also a very open-minded individual and welcome any and all kinds of criticism or suggestions to further improve myself as an individual.</p>
